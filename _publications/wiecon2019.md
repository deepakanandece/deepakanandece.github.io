Breast cancer has the highest mortality among cancers in women. Computer-aided pathology to analyze microscopic histopathology images for diagnosis with an increasing number of breast cancer patients can bring the cost and delays of diagnosis down. Deep learning in histopathology has attracted attention over the last decade of achieving state-of-the-art performance
in classification and localization tasks. The convolutional neural network, a deep learning framework, provides remarkable results in tissue images analysis, but lacks in providing interpretation and reasoning behind the decisions. We aim to provide a better interpretation of classification results by providing localization on microscopic histopathology images. We frame the image classification problem as weakly supervised multiple instance learning problem where an image is collection of patches i.e. instances. Attention-based multiple instance learning (A-MIL) learns attention on the patches from the image to localize the malignant and normal regions in an image and use them to classify the image. We present classification and localization results on two publicly available BreakHIS and BACH dataset. The classification and visualization results are compared with
other recent techniques. The proposed method achieves better localization results without compromising classification accuracy.
