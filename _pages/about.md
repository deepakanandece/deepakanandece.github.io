My name is Deepak Anand, and I work at [Nference](https://nference.com/) as Data Science Manager. Nference is popularly known as [Google of Medicine](https://twitter.com/_nference/status/1323008059472576522?lang=en). At Nference, I work on applied computer vision in medical images, including radiology and histopathology. With multiple spin-cos like [Anumana](https://www.anumana.ai/) and [Pramana](https://pramana.ai/), Nference aims to build a completely aware (using all the modalities rather than one or two) suite of algorithms which can benefit patients significantly.

Previously, I worked as Head of AI at [Griffyn Robotech Pvt. Limited](https://phoenix.tech/griffyn/). I was working at Griffyn Robotech Pvt. Limited to bring the edge of AI to industrial automation and operations analytics. We built a patented micron-level cosmetic grading machine for surface inspections.

By education, I completed my Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. For my Ph.D., I worked in the area of deep learning applications to medical images, specifically for cancer diagnosis and prognosis at MeDAL (Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab).
I maintain a list of my publications, patents, and research implementations under the [Publications]({{ site.url }}/publications) tab. To get an insight into my professional life so far, you can have a look at my CV.
I blog now and then, compiling my personal experiences. Feel free to read a bit more about me!
