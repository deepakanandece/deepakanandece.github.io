My name is Deepak Anand, and I am a PhD Scholar in [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). I recently graduated from the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Bombay.

I maintain a list of my publications and research implementations under the Research tab. To get an insight on my professional life so far, you can have a look at my CV.

I blog every now and then compiling my personal experiences. Feel free to read a bit more about me!

# Changelog -- bugfixes and enhancements

There is one logistical issue with a ready-to-fork template theme like academic pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you fork this repository, customize it, then pull again, you'll probably get merge conflicts. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch.
